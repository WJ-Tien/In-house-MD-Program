## class importanceSampling (python3 version= testing code) 

0. Dimensionless kb = 1 

1. Method "withFiction_sysPotential" is on the basis of "sysPotential"

2. Method "ABF" are on the basis of "sysForce", "Jacobian", "inverseGradient"

## Note 
1. Higher gamma, better sampling
2. The point on pi must be discarded due to PBC condition (Boltzmann Distribution)

## Equipartition theorem
1. For three dimensions molecular dynamics, the kinetic energy equals to 3/2 * kb * T
2. For one dimnesion molecular dynamics, the kinetic energy equals to 1/2 * kb * T
