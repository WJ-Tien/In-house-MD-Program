To implement free energy sampling method, we need to take advantage of the mdEngine but "not to modify" the engine itself.
Instead we use a python advanced concept called "decorator" to decorate the mdEngine so as to perform free energy sampling method with the core part of engine being un-modified.

the value of the rightmost bin = the value of the leftmost bin so as to retain PBC

ABF = adpative biasing "force"
ABP = adpative biasing "potential"


* Issues
1. factor = 2 or 4 for random force?
2. freeE result for histANN-2D seems weird since the curve monotonically increasing as the increment of the time step. 
3. the freeE result histANN-1D seems normal but not that accurate
