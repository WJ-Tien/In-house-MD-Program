IMPLM NOTE1:
  To implement free energy sampling method, we need to take advantage of the mdEngine but "not to modify" the engine itself.
  Instead we use a python advanced concept called "decorator" to decorate the mdEngine so as to perform free energy sampling method with the core part of engine being un-modified.

IMPLM NOTE:
  The value of the rightmost bin = the value of the leftmost bin so as to retain PBC

NOMENCLATURE:
  ABF = adpative biasing "force"
  ABP = adpative biasing "potential"

SIM NOTE:
  gamma=2 for 1D, gamma=2 for 2D so as to reach thermal equilibrium as time_step=0.005 (0.5 can be another choice)
  {1 / (100 * 0.005) = 2}
