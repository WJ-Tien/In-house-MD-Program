Regular MD: works well

ABF:
random force has almost the same magnitude. 10-3
In fast dynamics system, drag force ~= 10-3 (hard to converge)
In slow dynamics system, draf force ~= 10-6 (easy to converge)
drag force dominates the dynamics of the system

ABF-ANN:
1. Inherit those effects from ABF
2. NN itself can cause deviation which originates from initial variable 
3. If faster dynamics --> lower training frequency
